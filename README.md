## 🐍 Python for Security (Mini-Roadmap)
*Spend 30 mins of your daily 2 hours on this starting in Month 4.*
1. **Basics:** Variables, Loops, Functions.
2. **Libraries:** `requests` (for web), `scapy` (for packets), `socket` (for connections).
3. **Project 1:** Build a simple **Port Scanner**.
4. **Project 2:** Build a **Keylogger** (for educational purposes).
5. **Project 3:** Build a **Password Cracker** (Dictionary attack).

## 📝 Learning Strategy: The 45/75 Split
To master these skills, divide your 120 minutes daily:
1. **Theory (45 Mins):** Watch videos, read documentation, or study protocols.
2. **Active Doing (75 Mins):** Open the terminal, solve a lab, or write code. **No "tutorial hell"—if you aren't typing, you aren't learning.**

## 🚀 2026 Future-Proofing
- **AI Security:** Follow [OWASP Top 10 for LLMs](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/).
- **Cloud:** Learn one provider (AWS/Azure/GCP).
- **Zero Trust:** Understand why "never trust, always verify" is the current industry standard.
